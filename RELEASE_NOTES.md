# Release notes

Notable changes are documented here.
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) is the record behind them: this file says
what a user has to act on, that one says what changed.

Versions are *[calendar versions](https://calver.org/)*, `YYYY.M.D`: the
number says when a release was cut, and promises nothing about
compatibility, so a breaking change is announced in this file — read it
before upgrading, rather than a digit.

## v2026.10.16

- **btclib-wallet 2026.9.30 to 2026.10.9 fail at import beside btclib-ecc
  2026.10.16** (issue btclib-org/.github#1742). `import btclib_wallet.bip32`
  raises `ImportError`, and so does importing `psbt`, `descriptors` or
  `wallet`: btclib-ecc 2026.10.16 renames `point_from_octets` to
  `point_from_octets_var`, with no alias. Upgrade to this release, or keep
  btclib-ecc below 2026.10.16.

- **`silent_payments.output_keys` returns the keys in the order of the
  addresses** ([ISS 415](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/415)).
  Through 2026.10.9 it grouped them by scan key, so for `[A1, B, A2]`, A1 and
  A2 sharing a scan key, key 1 was A2's and key 2 was B's. A transaction that
  paired key `i` with address `i` paid B's amount to A2 and A2's amount to B.
  Upgrade. Act on it if you reordered the keys yourself: stop reordering
  them.

### Breaking changes

- **btclib-wallet requires btclib 2026.10.16 and btclib-ecc 2026.10.16**
  (issue btclib-org/.github#1742). Act on it if you pin either lower. Their
  own release notes list what else they change.
- **`block_header_from_raw` takes a required, keyword-only `network`**
  ([ISS 328](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/328)). It
  checks the proof of work against that network's limit, where it used
  mainnet's for every network. So the Electrum, Esplora, Bitcoin Core and Core
  REST fetchers read regtest and signet headers. Act on it if you call it:
  pass the network's name.
- **`ElectrumFetcher.assert_network` raises `BTClibValueError` for a server
  of another chain** ([ISS 341](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/341)).
  A mainnet fetcher over a regtest server raised `FetchError`, which
  `FallbackFetcher` falls through. Act on it if you catch `FetchError` there:
  catch `BTClibValueError`.
- **`psbt.combine` keeps the first psbt's value for a key that several
  psbts hold** ([ISS 325](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/325)),
  as Bitcoin Core does. It kept the last one's. Act on it if a later psbt
  was meant to win: put it first.
- **A psbt is refused for a BIP32 derivation key Bitcoin Core refuses**
  ([ISS 342](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/342),
  [ISS 356](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/356),
  [ISS 377](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/377)). In the
  global map the key is a 78-byte xpub whose public key is a point. In an
  input or output map it is a 33- or 65-byte public key that is a point.
  Parsing, validating and serializing refuse any other. Act on it if you
  build such a psbt: put the key BIP174 names there.
- **`psbt_utils.deserialize_map` takes a required `which`**
  ([ISS 351](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/351)): the
  map's name, `global`, `input` or `output`, for its refusal. Act on it if
  you call it: pass the name.
- **`multipath_descriptors` refuses what Bitcoin Core refuses**
  ([ISS 299](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/299),
  [ISS 301](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/301),
  [ISS 353](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/353),
  [ISS 365](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/365),
  [ISS 367](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/367),
  [ISS 397](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/397)). It
  expanded these, and refuses them: a key origin fingerprint that is not 8
  hex digits; a step with a repeated value, as `<1;1>`; a path element that
  is no index; a key with a `[` and no `]`, or more than one `]`; a
  `musig()` outside `tr()` and `rawtr()`; a `musig()` with a path and a
  ranged participant; a hardened item of a step in a `musig()` path; a
  multipath step in the argument of a function that takes no key, as
  `older(<1;2>)`. `parse` refused each expansion, except those of the
  repeated value and of `older(<1;2>)`, and the unhardened ones of a
  hardened `musig()` step. Act on it if you hold such a descriptor: write it
  as Core reads it.
- **`DescriptorWallet` refuses two branches that share a script**
  ([ISS 411](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/411),
  [ISS 414](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/414)),
  however their descriptors are spelled: a key origin added, a child xpub for
  a derivation step, or a fixed chain that is an index of a ranged one.
  `position_of` answered the first branch for both. The constructor derives
  every chain at index 0, so a chain it cannot derive, such as a hardened
  step with no `prv_keys`, is refused there. Act on it if you built such a
  wallet: give each branch its own chain, and the private keys a hardened
  step needs.
- **`Descriptor.index_of` and `RangedWallet.position_of` refuse a
  `last_index` that is not a non-negative integer**
  ([ISS 407](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/407),
  [ISS 413](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/413)): a
  negative one with `BTClibValueError`, where they answered `None`, and a
  `str`, `None`, `bytes`, `float` or `bool` with `BTClibTypeError`.
  `KeyExpression.sec` refuses an index that is not an int from 0 to
  2**31 - 1, as `Descriptor` does, a fixed key's included, and so do
  `Miniscript.script` and `Miniscript.satisfy` through it
  ([ISS 383](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/383),
  [ISS 404](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/404)). Act on
  it if you pass another: pass an int in range.
- **`hwi` looks a bare executable name up in the absolute directories of
  the PATH alone** ([ISS 416](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/416),
  [ISS 422](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/422)). An empty
  or relative PATH entry is skipped, and on Windows the current directory is
  not searched and a bare name with no period is looked for as `<name>.exe`
  only. A name with a directory part is checked as the file it names. Act
  on it if `hwi` was found another way: put its directory on the PATH as an
  absolute path, or pass the absolute path.
- **The messages of some refusals change, and print no key bytes**
  ([ISS 351](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/351),
  [ISS 388](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/388),
  [ISS 299](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/299),
  [ISS 367](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/367),
  [ISS 370](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/370),
  [ISS 358](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/358),
  [ISS 374](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/374)): a
  duplicated psbt map key, the MuSig2 and silent-payment key checks, a
  partial signature, `bip85.mnemonic_from_root_key`'s `words` and `lang`, an
  extended key whose public key is not a point, a multipath step glued to a
  key, and the Esplora and Core fee estimate replies. `parse` refuses a
  multipath step in a `musig()` path as `multipath key expression: use
  multipath_descriptors first`. `parse` and `multipath_descriptors` report
  the fault Bitcoin Core reads first in a descriptor with more than one. A
  refused partial signature or MuSig2 key chains no `__cause__`, and
  `bip85.mnemonic_from_root_key` refuses a `words` that is not an int with
  `BTClibTypeError`, where it raised `BTClibValueError`. Act on it if you
  match the old text: match the new one. Act on it if you catch
  `BTClibValueError` for `words`: catch `BTClibTypeError` too.

### New

- **`btclib_wallet.dlc` builds, signs and verifies Discreet Log Contracts**
  ([ISS 331](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/331),
  [ISS 332](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/332)): the
  funding, execution and refund transactions of dlcspecs, their adaptor
  signatures, and the oracle announcements and attestations.

`CHANGELOG.md`'s own `v2026.10.16` section has the rest.

## v2026.10.9

- **A refused import, a password in an Esplora URL, a key that is not a
  point, a mistyped extended key and a BIP38 password are no longer quoted**
  ([GHSA-8qrf-j8jh-cx23](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/security/advisories/GHSA-8qrf-j8jh-cx23)).
  Releases 2026.9.24 to 2026.10.8 can put a private key, a hash of one or a
  password in an exception, the Esplora URL from 2026.9.30
  ([PR 311](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/pull/311)).
  Upgrade, and treat a key or password that such an error may have logged or
  shown as exposed.

- **The messages of those refusals changed.** `core_import.assert_imported`
  raises `import refused for request {position}: error code {code}`.
  `EsploraFetcher` refuses any `@` in `base_url`, and an invalid port as
  `invalid base_url port`. A key that is not a point is refused with its
  prefix byte only, and a bad checksum or a non-ASCII character in an
  extended key with fixed text. `bip38` refuses a password that is not
  UTF-8 with `BTClibValueError` instead of `UnicodeEncodeError`. An
  out-of-range derivation index and a master fingerprint of the wrong length
  are refused without their value. A caller that matches on the old
  messages, or catches `UnicodeEncodeError` from `bip38`, has to change.

- **The btclib floor is 2026.10.8**
  ([ISS 306](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/306)). Through
  2026.10.7, btclib quotes a refused network name whole, so
  `KeyWallet(network=wif)` put the WIF in the error
  ([GHSA-c6h8-5hv5-3gv7](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib/security/advisories/GHSA-c6h8-5hv5-3gv7)).

- **`Descriptor.expand(index, prv_keys)` is new.** It returns the scripts and
  the provider at `index`, what `script_pub_keys` and `provider` return, from
  one derivation of each key, as Bitcoin Core's `Descriptor::Expand` does. A
  caller that needs both can call it instead of the two, and derive every key
  once rather than twice
  ([ISS 303](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/303)).
  `provider` called alone also derives each key once now. Nothing is removed
  or changed in what the existing methods return.

`CHANGELOG.md`'s own `v2026.10.9` section has the rest.

## v2026.10.8

- **A refused multipath step in a key origin is no longer quoted.** In
  v2026.10.7, a step such as `[deadbeef/<WIF;1>]` was put in the error message
  of `descriptors.parse` and `descriptors.multipath_descriptors`, so a private
  key (WIF) in it was echoed. This release leaves the step out
  ([PR 285](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/pull/285)). Upgrade if
  you parse descriptors that may hold a private key and log or show the
  errors. Treat a key in such an error from 2026.10.7 as exposed
  ([GHSA-62jf-v327-86h5](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/security/advisories/GHSA-62jf-v327-86h5),
  published after this release).

- **`multipath_descriptors` and `parse` refuse a multipath step that is not a
  whole path element.** `<0;1>h`, `<0;1>'`, `0<0;1>`, `<0;1>>` and `<<0;1>`,
  in a key path or a key origin, raise `BTClibValueError` "Key path value is
  not a valid uint32"
  ([ISS 280](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-wallet/issues/280)).
  Bitcoin Core refuses each, with that message except `<0;1>>` and `<<0;1>`
  in a key origin, which it refuses as a multipath step. v2026.10.7's
  `multipath_descriptors` expanded them, except `<0;1>>` and `<<0;1>` in a
  key origin, which it refused as Core does. Write a hardened step as
  `<0h;1h>`. A caller that matches on the message of another step in a key
  origin finds the step gone from it: the message is "Key path value
  specifies multipath in a section where multipath is not allowed".

`CHANGELOG.md`'s own `v2026.10.8` section has the rest.

## v2026.10.7

- **btclib-wallet requires btclib 2026.10.5**, which fixes
  GHSA-9r97-9x22-2pp4 and GHSA-rw95-w37r-537w: verifying a taproot input took
  time linear in the transaction's inputs, and each legacy or segwit v0
  signature check computed its hash from scratch. `bip322.verify` runs that
  verification on a signature it was given. Upgrading btclib-wallet installs
  it.

- **`request_signatures` refuses to send a psbt asking for a sig_hash type
  other than SIGHASH_ALL or SIGHASH_DEFAULT.** It raises on an input asking
  for SIGHASH_NONE, SINGLE or ANYONECANPAY, before the signer is called; pass
  the types you accept as `allowed_sig_hash_types`.
  `SoftwareSigner` applies its own allow-list, so to sign such a psbt with it,
  call its `sign_psbt` directly with `allowed_sig_hash_types`.

- **`musig2.partial_sign` and `frost.partial_sign` refuse an input without its
  `non_witness_utxo`, unless every input is taproot and none asks for
  ANYONECANPAY** (GHSA-v4gq-j2v2-c4jp). Give each input the
  transaction it spends as its `non_witness_utxo`. Pass
  `require_non_witness_utxo=False` only where you know every `witness_utxo`
  amount is right.

- **A psbt updated from a descriptor carries a derivation for every key**, as
  Bitcoin Core's does. A key the descriptor gives no origin has an entry under
  its own fingerprint, so `hd_key_paths` and `taproot_hd_key_paths` are not
  empty for such a descriptor.

- **`HwiSigner.sign_psbt` refuses a psbt asking for a sig_hash type other
  than SIGHASH_ALL or SIGHASH_DEFAULT.** It raises before `hwi` runs; pass the
  types you accept as its keyword-only `allowed_sig_hash_types`.
  `request_signatures` does not pass its allow-list on, so to send such a psbt
  to a device, call `sign_psbt` directly and hold its answer with
  `assert_signatures_only(psbt, answer)` before `combine`.

- **A `ScriptWallet` psbt carries a derivation for every key**, as a
  descriptor's does. A key of a `KeyGroup` given no origin has an entry under
  its own fingerprint, so `hd_key_paths` is not empty for such a group. Of
  two explicit origins for one key, the first is written, not the last.

- **The attestation bundle is attached as `v<version>.intoto.jsonl`** from
  v2026.10.4 on, where earlier releases attach `v<version>.attestation.jsonl`.
  A script that downloads it by name, or passes it to
  `gh attestation verify --bundle`, uses the new name.

- **`sign`, `request_signatures` and `HwiSigner.sign_psbt` raise on an input
  asking for SIGHASH_SINGLE with no output at its index**, whatever
  `allowed_sig_hash_types` says. Such a signature commits to no output, so
  whoever holds it can spend the input to any output. Give the input an
  output at its index, or ask for another type. `finalize` still checks a
  signature of this kind.

- **A regtest silent payment address starts with `sprt1`**, as Bitcoin Core's
  regtest requires, where earlier releases give `tsp1`. `keys_from_address`
  reads both, with the network type `"test"`. Make a stored regtest `tsp1`
  address again with `address_from_keys(..., "regtest")`, and update any
  `tsp1` string a test compares against.

- **`Bolt11Invoice.from_invoice` refuses malformed or repeated fields.** A `p`,
  `s`, `h` or `n` of the wrong length, a second `p`, `s`, `d`, `h` or `n`, an
  `x`, `c` or `9` starting with a zero word, and an amount with a leading zero
  raise `BTClibValueError`, where earlier releases skipped a wrong-length
  field, read the first of a repeated one, or read an amount without its
  leading zeros. This includes an invoice
  that an earlier `sign` wrote with `expiry=0` or `min_final_cltv_expiry=0`:
  sign it again.

- **A psbt keeps an explicit `sig_hash_type` of 0 through `serialize` and
  `combine`.** `sign` refuses an ECDSA input asking for it after a round trip
  through bytes too, where it signed SIGHASH_ALL. `HwiSigner.sign_psbt` and
  `request_signatures` refuse SIGHASH_DEFAULT on an input not known to be
  taproot, where a device signed SIGHASH_ALL.
  To sign such a psbt, ask its creator for SIGHASH_ALL or remove the field.

- **`silent_payments.output_keys` refuses an address of another network than
  its `network` argument**, `"mainnet"` by default, as Bitcoin Core's
  decoder does. An `sprt`, `tsp` or `sp` address that is not that network's
  raises `BTClibValueError`, so a caller paying testnet, signet or regtest
  passes the `network` too.

- **`wallet_policy_descriptor`, `wallet_policy_address` and `wallet_policy`
  refuse a template BIP388 does not allow.** A top-level `multi()` or
  `sortedmulti()`, and a `pk()` inside `sh()`, raise `BTClibValueError`; so do
  a top-level `pk()`, `combo()` or `rawtr()` in the first two, where earlier
  releases gave a descriptor or an address. Read such a descriptor with
  `descriptors.parse`.

`CHANGELOG.md`'s own `v2026.10.7` section has the rest.

## v2026.10.4

- **Signing refuses a sig_hash type other than SIGHASH_ALL or
  SIGHASH_DEFAULT unless the caller allows it** (GHSA-qq38-77mp-j6wr).
  `sign`, `SoftwareSigner.sign_psbt`, `musig2.partial_sign` and
  `frost.partial_sign` raise on an input asking for SIGHASH_NONE, SINGLE or
  ANYONECANPAY; pass the types you accept as `allowed_sig_hash_types`.
  `request_signatures` passes none, so call `SoftwareSigner.sign_psbt`
  directly to sign such a psbt. A legacy SIGHASH_SINGLE input with no output
  at its index is refused whatever is allowed, and `ecdsa_sig_hash` and
  `PsbtView.ecdsa_sig_hash` refuse it too. `finalize`, `assert_signed` and
  `assert_signatures_only` refuse an ECDSA signature other than SIGHASH_ALL on
  an input without `PSBT_IN_SIGHASH_TYPE`; set the field on a psbt whose
  signatures use another type.

- **`sign`, `SoftwareSigner.sign_psbt` and `Psbt.assert_signable` refuse an
  input without its `non_witness_utxo`, unless every input is taproot and none
  asks for ANYONECANPAY** (GHSA-v4gq-j2v2-c4jp). Give each input the
  transaction it spends as its `non_witness_utxo`. Pass
  `require_non_witness_utxo=False` only where you know every `witness_utxo`
  amount is right: a wrong one can be spent as fee.

- **btclib-wallet requires btclib 2026.10.4, btclib-ecc 2026.10.2 and
  btclib-secp256k1 0.8.0.10.** btclib 2026.10.4 fixes GHSA-9fr5-46w5-5f9r,
  which made `bip322.verify` run for minutes on a crafted signature;
  0.8.0.10 fixes GHSA-8h6f-34jj-7p6c, an invalid-curve oracle in
  `silentpayments.scan_outputs`. Upgrading btclib-wallet installs btclib and
  btclib-ecc; the `secp256k1` extra installs the bindings.

- **Verifying a release's attestation names a new signer and the tag.**
  `gh attestation verify` takes
  `--signer-workflow btclib-org/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-build.yml@refs/heads/main`
  and `--source-ref refs/tags/v<version>`; SECURITY.md has the command.
  Earlier releases keep `reusable-attest.yml`.

- **`descriptors.parse` refuses a key of another network.** A WIF or an
  extended key whose prefix is not the `network`'s raises
  `BTClibValueError` there, where the WIF was accepted and the extended key
  was refused only by `script_pub_keys()`. A caller that parses a descriptor
  for a network its keys are not of has to pass the right `network`.

- **`bip39.mxprv_from_mnemonic` and `electrum.mxprv_from_mnemonic` refuse
  a falsy passphrase of another type.** An empty `bytes`, `0`, `False` or
  `[]` derived the wallet without a passphrase; pass `None` or `""` for that.

- **A miniscript repeating a public key is refused under different
  spellings of it.** `descriptors.parse` does so as Bitcoin Core does, except
  for a key with a hardened step.

- **A malleable miniscript keeps neither "s", "f" nor "e".**
  `Miniscript.properties` drops them, and `is_signature_required` is false for
  it.

- **`join` empties the signatures of a version 0 psbt, and `sign` updates a
  version 2 psbt's modifiable flags.** Sign the joined psbt again. `join`
  refuses a version 2 psbt signed with anything but SIGHASH_NONE|ANYONECANPAY.

- **`extract_tx` verifies by default.** It runs every input's scripts and
  checks that the outputs do not exceed the inputs, so it raises on a psbt it
  extracted before: one with a bad signature, a missing utxo or outputs above
  the inputs. Pass `verify_scripts=False` to extract without the check.

- **`join` refuses to change the lock time or the tx version of a signed
  version 2 psbt.** The signatures would stop verifying. Join the psbts before
  they are signed, or give them the same lock time and tx version.

- **`Miniscript.has_duplicate_keys`, `is_sane`, `is_sane_subexpression` and
  `insane_sub` are methods.** Call them with parentheses; without them,
  `if node.is_sane:` is always true, and mypy reports it as `truthy-function`.
  Pass `prv_keys`, the mapping `parse` fills, to derive a hardened step:
  `descriptors.parse` refuses `wsh(or_i(pk(XPRV/1h),pk(<the key it derives>)))`.
  Without its private key, a key with a hardened step is still compared as
  written.

- **`descriptors.parse` refuses a threshold no script can meet.** A `multi()`
  or `sortedmulti()` threshold of zero or above its key count, and a
  `multi_a()` or `sortedmulti_a()` one of zero, above its key count, or of more
  than 999 keys, raise `BTClibValueError`, where they were stored. A
  `thresh()` of more than 1000 arguments is refused too, a limit of this
  library.

- **A number of over 4300 digits is a `BTClibValueError`.** A derivation
  index, a threshold, an `older()` or `after()` number and a `@N` of that size
  raised the built-in `ValueError`; they are refused at ten digits now.
  `Bolt11Invoice.from_invoice` refuses an amount of more than 20 digits, which
  its amount parser read up to 4300 digits.

- **A `prv_keys` that is not a mapping raises `BTClibTypeError`.** The
  descriptor, `KeyExpression`, `Miniscript` and `DescriptorWallet` methods
  taking it, and `descriptors.normalized`, check it as `parse` does, where a
  string raised `AttributeError`.

- **`SilentPaymentOutput`'s `repr` leaves out `prv_key_tweak`.** The tweak is
  a secret; read the field, not the `repr`, where you need it.

`CHANGELOG.md`'s own `v2026.10.4` section has the rest.

## v2026.9.30

A binary-string entropy passed as `bytes` is refused with a
`BTClibTypeError` by `mnemonic.entropy`'s functions taking one, which
read it as the digits it spells; pass the `str` instead. A mnemonic that
is not a `str` is refused with a `BTClibTypeError` rather than a bare
`TypeError` or `AttributeError`.

`mnemonic.slip39.master_secret_from_mnemonics` and `mxprv_from_mnemonics`
refuse shares passed as an iterable that is not a sequence -- a set, a
generator, an iterator, `dict.keys()` -- with a `BTClibTypeError`, where
they read it; pass a `list` or a `tuple` instead.

`mnemonic.slip39.mnemonics_from_master_secret` refuses with a
`BTClibTypeError` a `groups` passed as a set or a dict, and a bool as a
threshold, a member count or the iteration exponent, where it read them;
pass a `list` or a `tuple` of integer pairs, and integers.
`mnemonic.entropy.bin_str_entropy_from_rolls` refuses the same way rolls
passed as a set or a generator and a bool as a roll or as `bits`.

`mnemonic.slip39.Share` refuses with a `BTClibTypeError` a `value` that is
not `bytes` -- a `bytearray` or a list of ints included -- and a bool as
an integer field or a non-bool as `extendable`, where it held them; pass
`bytes`, integers and a bool. `mxprv_from_mnemonics` refuses a falsy
passphrase of another type, `0`, `[]` or `b""`, where it read the empty
passphrase; pass `None` or `""`. `mnemonics_from_master_secret` refuses
an `entropy_source` answering anything but `bytes` or a `bytearray` of
the length asked -- a 1-of-1 backup read a list, a `memoryview` or a
draw of another length; return exactly that.

`fetch.BitcoinCoreFetcher` and `fetch.BitcoinCoreRestFetcher` refuse with a
`BTClibTypeError` a `client` that is not a `BitcoinCoreRpcClient` or a
`BitcoinCoreRestClient` respectively, where a stand-in answering the
methods they call worked; pass an instance of that class or a subclass.
`fetch.ElectrumFetcher` refuses a `timeout` that is no number, a bool,
not positive, or above `threading.TIMEOUT_MAX`, which it handed as given
to a transport of the caller's; pass a positive number of seconds. `fetch.EsploraFetcher`
refuses a `base_url` carrying a user or a password, or without a host,
which a transport of the caller's received; pass the url without them,
and let that transport add the credentials.

`tx_builder.build_psbt`, `coin_selection.select_coins`, `knapsack` and
`single_random_draw` require `change_script_pub_key`: a call that left it
out, and so sent every leftover satoshi to the fee, raises a `TypeError`;
pass the change script, or `None` for a sweep.

`tx_builder.build_psbt` refuses with a `BTClibValueError` a fee above
`max_fee`, 0.10 BTC unless raised, and an output being paid below its
dust threshold. It refuses a non-zero `lock_time` too when every input's
sequence is final: set a non-final `PsbtIn.sequence`, such as
`0xfffffffe`, on an input for the lock time to bind.

`psbt.sign` refuses with a `BTClibValueError` a psbt paying a silent payment
it used to sign: one whose silent payment output has no script yet -- run
`psbt.silent_payments.set_input_share` or `set_global_share`, then
`set_output_scripts`, before signing -- one with an input's sighash other
than `SIGHASH_ALL`, and one whose shares, scripts or modifiable flags
`psbt.silent_payments.assert_as_valid` refuses. `psbt.extract_tx` refuses
what that function refuses, and a silent payment output with no script;
`check_validity=False` extracts as before. `psbt.combine` refuses two psbts
carrying different scripts for one silent payment output.

`tx_builder.build_psbt` also refuses with a `BTClibValueError` a fee above
what `max_fee_rate`, 0.10 BTC/kvB unless raised, asks of the estimated
virtual size, however far below `max_fee` it is; pass a higher
`max_fee_rate` where such a fee is meant.

A psbt with an input whose `witness_utxo` is not, in amount and script,
the output of its `non_witness_utxo` the outpoint names is refused with a
`BTClibValueError` by `Psbt.assert_valid`, and so by `Psbt.parse` and
every function validating the psbt, where it was accepted and the
`witness_utxo` read; set it to that output, or drop it.
`bip322.assert_as_valid` refuses a proof of funds in which it contradicts
the transaction an earlier input carries.

`psbt.estimated_input_sizes` refuses with a `BTClibValueError` a
`psbt_in` whose `non_witness_utxo` is not the transaction the `tx_in`'s
outpoint names, and one whose `witness_utxo` differs from the output that
outpoint names, where it answered an estimate; pass the
`TxIn` the input is spent by, and a `witness_utxo` equal to that output.

`psbt_signer.request_signatures` refuses a psbt paying a silent payment that
`psbt.sign` would refuse, before the signer is asked, where it sent it on.
`psbt.silent_payments` counts an input by the script it spends, and refuses
with a `BTClibValueError` a counted input whose key the psbt does not carry
where it left the input out: give every p2wpkh, p2pkh and p2sh-p2wpkh input
a `PSBT_IN_BIP32_DERIVATION` whose key the script commits to, and a p2sh
input its redeem script. A taproot input whose internal key is BIP341's NUMS
point is counted unless `PSBT_IN_TAP_MERKLE_ROOT` or a control block proves
it. `set_output_scripts` refuses until every counted input has a share, where
it derived the scripts from the shares there were.

`hwi.HwiSigner.sign_psbt` called directly refuses such a psbt the same way,
before `hwi` runs, where it sent it to the device; and it refuses a request
that is no `Psbt` with a `BTClibTypeError` rather than an `AttributeError`.

`psbt.combine` refuses with a `BTClibValueError` psbts whose merge
`Psbt.assert_valid` refuses, where it returned that psbt; drop from the
copies the field that contradicts the others -- a `witness_utxo` differing
from another copy's `non_witness_utxo` output -- before combining.
It refuses with a `BTClibTypeError` a `psbts` that is not a sequence -- a
generator, an iterator -- where it read it; pass a `list` or a `tuple`.

`psbt.join` refuses with a `BTClibTypeError` a `psbts` that is not a
sequence -- a `dict` view, any container that is only iterable -- where it
joined it; pass a `list` or a `tuple`.

`descriptors.KeyExpression` refuses with a `BTClibValueError` an extended
private key as `xkey`, where it held it; pass its xpub, and the xprv under
that xpub in `prv_keys` where a hardened step needs it.

`descriptors.KeyExpression`'s `xkey` holds an extended public key of a
version btclib decodes, a wallet-policy placeholder `wallet_policy` writes
-- `@N`, `@N/**`, `@N/<M;N>/*`, `musig(@N,...)` with one of those suffixes,
`K` -- or nothing. Any other `str` is refused with a `BTClibValueError` and
any other type with a `BTClibTypeError`, where they were held; pass an xpub.

`silent_payments.keys_from_address` refuses with a `BTClibValueError` a
mixed-case address and one holding a character outside ASCII, where it read
the address the string lowers to; pass the address all lower case or all
upper case. For such a spelling of an address a wallet handed out,
`address in wallet` answers `False` and `Wallet.address_info` raises, where
both found the address.

`silent_payments.keys_from_address` and `silent_payments.output_keys`,
which reads each address through it, `BIP32KeyData.b58decode` and what
reads an extended key through it, `bip32.derive` among them,
`bip322.Sig.b64decode`, `bip322.verify` and `assert_as_valid` for the
signature, `Psbt.b64decode`, `tx_or_psbt.tx_or_psbt_from_any`,
`BIP32KeyOrigin.from_description` and `bip32.str_from_der_path`'s
fingerprint strip only space, tab, newline, carriage return, vertical tab
and form feed. Text padded with U+00A0, U+3000, U+2028, U+0085 or another
character outside ASCII that `str.isspace` counts is refused with a
`BTClibValueError`, where it was read as the value it wraps, and so is
text padded with U+001C to U+001F. For such a spelling of an address a
wallet handed out, `address in wallet` answers `False` and
`Wallet.address_info` raises. Strip that padding before passing the text.

`mnemonic.entropy.bin_str_entropy_from_int` refuses with a
`BTClibValueError` a string entropy that is not ASCII digits -- binary after
`0b`, hex after `0x`, decimal otherwise -- once space, tab, newline,
carriage return, vertical tab and form feed are stripped around it, where
`int` read `0x1_0`, `1_6`, `+16` and fullwidth or Arabic-Indic digits as 16
and U+00A0 or U+3000 was stripped too. The functions reading a binary-string
entropy, `bin_str_entropy_from_str`, `bytes_entropy_from_str` and
`bin_str_entropy_from_entropy` among them, refuse one holding anything but
ASCII `0` and `1` -- a sign, `0b`, whitespace, an underscore -- which `int`
read as binary; `bytes_entropy_from_str` raised a bare `OverflowError` on a
leading `-`. Pass ASCII digits alone. The refusals read `invalid entropy:
what follows 0x is not ASCII hex digits` and `invalid entropy: not ASCII
decimal digits`, where they said `not a base 16 number` and `not a base 10
number`, and a negative entropy's reads `negative entropy`, without the
number. `bin_str_entropy_from_wordlist_indexes` and
`bin_str_entropy_from_rolls` name the range and not the value of an index or
a roll outside it: `invalid index: not in [0, 2048)`, `invalid roll: not in
[1-6]`. Match `invalid entropy`, `negative entropy`, `invalid index` and
`invalid roll` alone.

`descriptors.parse` refuses with a `BTClibValueError` a bare `multi()` or
`sortedmulti()` of more than three keys, one inside `sh()` whose redeem script
is over 520 bytes -- sixteen compressed keys are 547 -- and one of more than
twenty keys anywhere, where it parsed them; put the keys of the first two
inside `wsh()` or `sh(wsh())` instead. `wallet_policy_descriptor` refuses the
same, the descriptor it builds being read by `parse`.

`Psbt.b64decode` refuses with a `BTClibValueError` text holding a
character outside the base64 alphabet -- a line break, a space, U+001C,
`!` -- anywhere past the ASCII whitespace it strips from either end,
where it decoded the psbt the rest of the text spells. Remove the line
breaks from a wrapped psbt, or pass it to
`tx_or_psbt.tx_or_psbt_from_any`, which removes them.

`bip32.indexes_from_der_path`, `hardenings_from_der_path`,
`int_from_index_str` and every function reading a path string through
them, `bip32.derive` and `BIP32KeyOrigin.from_description` among them,
refuse with a `BTClibValueError` a step whose number is not ASCII decimal
digits -- `1_0`, `+1`, `-0`, fullwidth or Arabic-Indic digits -- or that is
padded with anything but space, tab, newline, carriage return, vertical tab
and form feed, where it was read as the number. With `bip380_enforced=True`
they refuse a step padded at all, and so `descriptors.parse` refuses a
step with a space around it. `BIP32KeyOrigin.from_description` refuses text
whose ninth character is not `/`, where it dropped that character and read
`deadbeef0/1` as `deadbeef/1`. `int_from_index_str` refuses a step that is
not a `str` with a `BTClibTypeError`, and reads a step with ASCII whitespace
after its symbol, `"0h "`, which it refused. Pass each step as ASCII digits.
The refusals read `invalid derivation index: not ASCII decimal digits` and
`invalid index: not below 2**31`, where they quoted the step or its number;
match those. `bip85`'s functions write their index into a path string, and
refuse a negative one with the first and one of 2**31 or more with the
second.

`descriptors.parse` and `miniscript.parse` refuse with a `BTClibValueError`
a `/` followed by no path step, in a key origin, after an extended key or
after a `musig()` -- `[deadbeef/]`, `xpub.../`, `xpub...//*`,
`musig(...)/` -- where they read the key expression as though that `/`
were absent. Remove the `/`; the refusal reads `invalid derivation index`.
`BIP32KeyOrigin.from_description`, whose reading of a path is the lenient
one, reads `deadbeef/` as `deadbeef`.

`Psbt.b64decode`, `bip322.Sig.b64decode`, and `bip322.verify` and
`assert_as_valid` for the signature, refuse with a `BTClibValueError`
base64 that is not the text `base64.b64encode` writes for its bytes, where
they read those bytes: a bit set in what the last character leaves over,
`YR==` read as `YQ==`, and on CPython and PyPy 3.11 an `=` after a whole
group. The refusal reads `invalid base64 encoding: not canonical`, and
`bip322.verify` raises it for a legacy signature so encoded, where it
answered `False`. `tx_or_psbt.tx_or_psbt_from_any` refuses such a `str` as
`neither hex nor base64`, and reads such bytes as a raw transaction, where
both were read as the psbt. Pass the text `base64.b64encode` writes, which
is the text Bitcoin Core writes and the only text it reads.

A refusal in `mnemonic` no longer quotes secret material, so its text
changed: an unknown word reads `unknown '<lang>' word at position <n>`,
where it was `unknown '<lang>' word: '<word>'`, and a SLIP-0039 one
`not in the SLIP-0039 word-list: words at positions [<n>, ...]`. A BIP39
checksum reads `invalid checksum: <n> words`, a SLIP-0039 padding
`invalid padding: must be all zeros`, and an unrecognized Electrum
sentence `unknown electrum mnemonic version; not in [...]`. Match the
new text if you match these. `mnemonic.mnemonic_from_indexes` refuses an
index outside the word-list, a negative one included, which read from
the end of the list; pass indexes in `[0, len(wordlist))`.
`WordLists.langs_of_words` refuses a lone `str`, which it read one
character at a time; pass the list of words.

`mnemonic.mnemonic_from_indexes` and `WordLists.langs_of_words` refuse
with a `BTClibTypeError` an iterable that is not a sequence -- a
generator, a set, an iterator -- where they read it; pass a `list` or a
`tuple`. `mnemonic_from_indexes` refuses too an index that is a bool or
an integer of a type other than `int`, `numpy.int64` or an object with
`__index__` included, where it read it; pass `int`s.
`dispatch.seed_type_from_mnemonic` and `all_seed_types_from_mnemonic`
refuse a `lang` that is not a `str` with a `BTClibTypeError`, where they
answered `""` and `[]`; pass the language code.

The BIP39, SLIP39 and Electrum mnemonic schemes are
[btclib-mnemonics](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-mnemonics)', a
dependency of this package, and `btclib_wallet.mnemonic` keeps what
builds a key from their seed: `bip39.mxprv_from_mnemonic`,
`slip39.mxprv_from_mnemonics`, `electrum.mxprv_from_mnemonic` and
`electrum.old_master_pub_key_from_mnemonic`. Every path below stops
resolving, and nothing re-exports it; import the name from
`btclib_mnemonics` instead. A refusal those four functions pass on from
`btclib_mnemonics`, of a mnemonic, a share or a passphrase, is that
package's own `BTClibMnemonicsTypeError` or `BTClibMnemonicsValueError`,
a `TypeError` or a `ValueError` and no `BTClibException`, where it was a
`BTClibTypeError` or a `BTClibValueError`; catch `TypeError` and
`ValueError`. `electrum.mxprv_from_mnemonic` still refuses a `2fa`, a
`2fa_segwit` or an `old` mnemonic with its own `BTClibValueError`, and for
an `old` one that refusal now ends `use old_master_pub_key_from_mnemonic`,
where it named `old_master_prv_key_from_mnemonic`. The paragraphs above
that name a function that moved describe it as it is under
`btclib_mnemonics`, where each `BTClibTypeError` or `BTClibValueError`
they name for it is a `BTClibMnemonicsTypeError` or a
`BTClibMnemonicsValueError`, and where the entropy conversions they name
are private.

The bound on a `timeout` that `fetch.ElectrumFetcher` refuses is
`fetch.transport.MAX_TIMEOUT`, 2147483 seconds, where the paragraph above
names `threading.TIMEOUT_MAX`; pass at most that many seconds.

`fetch.EsploraFetcher` refuses at construction, with a `BTClibTypeError`
or a `BTClibValueError`, a `timeout` that is no number, a bool, not
positive, or above `fetch.transport.MAX_TIMEOUT`, 2147483 seconds, where
its first fetch raised a `FetchError` and a timeout above that bound
reached a transport of the caller's. `fetch.transport.TlsLineTransport`
refuses a timeout above that bound with a `BTClibValueError`, where it
waited with one up to what the platform's socket took and failed past
it, with an `OverflowError` or, where the socket's wait refused it, a
`FetchError`; its refusals read `non-numeric timeout: <type>` and
`timeout is not a positive number of seconds up to 2147483`, where they
quoted the value. Pass a positive number of seconds up to that bound.

`CHANGELOG.md`'s own `v2026.9.30` section has the rest.

## v2026.9.24

The first release of `btclib-wallet`, whose modules leave `btclib`
(issue btclib-org/btclib#2129). A caller importing one of them from
`btclib` installs this package and imports it from `btclib_wallet`
instead, the path below the package unchanged: `btclib.bip32` becomes
`btclib_wallet.bip32`, `btclib.mnemonic.bip39` becomes
`btclib_wallet.mnemonic.bip39`.

`CHANGELOG.md`'s own `v2026.9.24` section has the rest.
