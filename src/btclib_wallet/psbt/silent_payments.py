"""The BIP375 roles: sending a silent payment through a psbt.

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0375.mediawiki

`btclib_wallet.psbt.psbt_in` and `btclib_wallet.psbt.psbt_out` carry BIP375's
six fields; this is what the two roles BIP375 adds *do* with them, and it is a
module rather than a function for the reason `btclib_wallet.psbt.musig2` is: a
role is a sequence of steps different parties take at different times.

**Why it matters more than a signature does.** A silent payment output
script is derived, not signed: get it wrong and the transaction is still
consensus-valid, so it confirms and the money is gone. The shares and the
BIP374 proofs are what make that derivation checkable by somebody holding
none of the keys -- and the Transaction Extractor is where the check has
to happen, being the last party before the bytes go on the wire.

The Signer's side, in the order BIP375 puts it:

- `set_input_share` writes an ECDH share and its proof for one input the
  Signer holds the key of; `set_global_share` writes the one pair that
  stands for every eligible input, which a Signer holding all the keys
  may do instead.
- `assert_shares_as_valid` is what a Signer does with the shares it did
  *not* write: every proof verified against the key of the input it
  covers, or against the sum of them for a global one.
- `set_output_scripts` computes what the recipients are paid, once every
  eligible input is covered, and clears the two modifiable flags -- the
  scripts depend on the input set, so nothing may be added afterwards.

`assert_as_valid` is the Extractor's, and it is the four checks BIP375's
own validator publishes, in its order: the fields, then the share
coverage and the proofs, then which inputs are allowed to be there at
all, then the output scripts recomputed and compared.

`btclib_wallet.psbt.psbt.sign` and `btclib_wallet.psbt.psbt.extract_tx`
run the checks of their own role whenever an output carries
PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO: `_assert_signable` and `_assert_extractable` are
what each asks. A psbt sent to a signer outside the process is asked
`_assert_sendable` first, which is `_assert_signable` for a psbt paying a
silent payment: `btclib_wallet.psbt_signer.request_signatures` asks it of
every signer, and `btclib_wallet.hwi.HwiSigner.sign_psbt` asks it of a
direct call.

**What a psbt input's public key is, and why it needs its own reader.**
`btclib_wallet.silent_payments.pub_key_from_input` reads it off a *signed*
input, from the witness or the scriptSig. An unsigned input has neither,
and BIP375 says where to look instead: the Updater "should add a
PSBT_IN_BIP32_DERIVATION for any p2wpkh, p2sh-p2wpkh, or p2pkh input so
the public key is available for creating the ecdh_shared_secret when the
private key is not known". `input_pub_key` is that reader, and it answers
None for an input BIP352 does not count -- a taproot NUMS internal key, a
p2sh wrapping anything but p2wpkh, a script type off the list.

**Which inputs count is decided by the script each one spends**, and not
by whether a key was found: the recipient sums the key of every input its
script type counts, so an input whose key the psbt does not carry is not
left out of the sum but refused. And nothing the psbt says about an input
is taken on its word -- a derivation key, a redeem script, a NUMS internal
key, a final scriptSig or witness each count only once checked against the
spent script, `_input_eligibility` saying how.

**The share is not the shared secret**, which is the thing in BIP375
easiest to get wrong: `a*B_scan` carries no input hash, and BIP352's
shared secret is `input_hash*a*B_scan`. So the Extractor multiplies the
share by the input hash, and the input hash needs the *sum of the public
keys* of the eligible inputs -- which is why reading those keys is the
first thing here and not an aside.

**The k of an output** is BIP375's own rule and not BIP352's ordering: it
counts per scan key, over the outputs in index order. That is what the
BIP's vectors and its reference validator do and *not* what its prose
says, which asks for the codes to be sorted lexicographically;
`_ordered_sp_outputs` is where the discrepancy is documented, and
`tests/psbt/silent_payments_test.py` says which of the vectors pins it.

    with the same scan key, sort the codes lexicographically in ascending
    order to determine the ordering of the k value."

    Measured against `bip375_test_vectors.json`, that sort produces the
    wrong scripts. Its "two sp outputs - output 0 uses label=3 / output 1
    uses label=1" case is published as *valid* and its two spend keys are
