"""The signatures of a DLC: adaptor signatures on CETs, and the witnesses.

https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/ECDSA-adaptor.md

Each party gives the other an adaptor signature of every CET, encrypted
under the outcome's signature point (`btclib_ecc.ecc.ecdsa_adaptor`), so
whoever holds the oracle's attestation decrypts it into an ordinary
signature. The refund transaction is signed outright. All of them spend
the funding output with SIGHASH_ALL.

**Only the agreed transactions are signed.** `sig_hash`, `sign` and
`adaptor_sign` take the `Dlc` and the unsigned transaction, and refuse
any transaction but those `btclib_wallet.dlc.transactions` builds from
those terms: the refund, or a CET of one of their payouts.
`verify_adaptor` answers False for any other. The script code and the
funding value come from the terms.

**Funding inputs are not signed here.** The wallet's signer signs them,
whatever the script; `complete_funding_tx` only places the witnesses it
produced.

**Adaptor signatures encrypt a secret the oracle knows.** The scheme
leaks a Diffie-Hellman key per signature, so it is for a signature point
of an oracle's attestation and for nothing else: see
`btclib_ecc.ecc.ecdsa_adaptor`. A refusal never prints a key or a scalar.
