"""BIP380 KEY expressions: what a descriptor names a public key with.

The bottom of the descriptor package, and the half of BIP380's grammar
that says nothing about scripts: a KEY expression is a public key, an
extended key with a derivation path, or BIP390's ``musig()`` aggregate of
either, optionally behind the ``[fingerprint/path]`` key origin a signer
needs. `KeyExpression` is what one parses to and `sec` is what it derives.

A module of its own because two modules above it read the same grammar.
`descriptors` reads it inside ``pk()``, ``multi()``, ``tr()`` and the rest;
`miniscript` reads it inside ``pk_k()``, ``pk_h()``, ``multi()`` and
``multi_a()`` -- BIP379's "Key expressions are specified in BIP380", the
same production and not a second dialect of it. Both import this one and
this one imports neither, which is the direction of the layering.

Three text helpers come with it, for the same reason: `_expression`,
`_split_arguments` and `_split_function` are what write a function out and
read one back, and both halves of the grammar are written in functions.
