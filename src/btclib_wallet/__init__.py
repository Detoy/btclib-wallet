"""The btclib_wallet package: what it publishes, and the version metadata.

Everything from a seed to a signed, broadcast transaction, and every
module with a counterparty outside the process -- a device, a node, a
server, a file from another wallet -- built on the protocol package
`btclib`. The dependency points one way: this package imports `btclib`,
and nothing in `btclib` imports this one. A name of this package is
published here and only here: `btclib` does not re-export it.

`__all__` is the root of the package's public tree: the packages and
top-level modules a caller reaches from this name, each of which declares
its own `__all__`. A list rather than `pkgutil.iter_modules`, so that a
module added to the directory does not publish itself.

`name` and the metadata dunders are not in it: each is still an
attribute here, `btclib_wallet.__version__` being how a caller reads the
version.

Nothing is imported eagerly. A module is imported when it is first asked
for, through the `__getattr__` at the bottom of this file, so `import
btclib_wallet` is the metadata lookup below and nothing else, and the
import graph keeps its shape: tests/imports_test.py imports each module
first, in a fresh interpreter, which an eager root would make impossible.
What that costs is that mypy reads a module-level `__getattr__` as a
promise that any attribute may exist, so a misspelling on this package is
a runtime `AttributeError` rather than a reported error; `from
btclib_wallet import bip32` and `import btclib_wallet.bip32` resolve
against the real modules and stay checked.
