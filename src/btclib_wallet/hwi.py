"""A `PsbtSigner` over Bitcoin Core HWI's JSON command line.

https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI

HWI speaks to Trezor, Ledger, KeepKey, Digital Bitbox, Coldcard, BitBox02
and Jade over HID, USB, serial and emulator transports, and publishes a
JSON command line so that other software need not. This module is that
other software: it runs `hwi` as a subprocess. Five of its commands
answer the contract `btclib_wallet.psbt_signer` defines; a sixth,
`registerdescriptor`, is wrapped beside them with no protocol of its own
to answer -- registering a policy is not a question `psbt_signer` asks.

**Nothing is imported from hwilib, and nothing has to be installed for
btclib to work.** HWI declares `hidapi`, `libusb1`, `cbor2`, `pyserial`,
`noiseprotocol`, `protobuf` and vendor libraries, and a Python range
narrower than btclib's; a mandatory dependency on that is the thing issue
btclib-org/btclib#381 rules out. What this module needs at runtime is an
executable, named by the caller and absent until a device is actually being
used, so the import costs nothing outside the standard library and the tests run
with no HWI at all.

An optional extra importing `hwilib` beside this was weighed and refused
(btclib-org/btclib#469), and the reason is that Python range: HWI declares
`^3.9,<3.13`, where this library's `requires-python` is `>=3.11`, so an extra
nobody can install on 3.13 or later is a second and narrower support matrix
rather than an option. A subprocess has no such problem, the executable living
in an environment of its own. What a caller who does hold an open `hwilib`
device writes instead is a `psbt_signer.PsbtSigner` of their own: that contract
names an in-process driver as one of its shapes, and it is met in the caller's
environment rather than in this one.

`enumerate_devices` is the one call that names no device; everything else
is `HwiSigner`, which is selected by fingerprint and passes `--fingerprint`
to every command it runs. That is issue btclib-org/btclib#381's own rule, and
the reason selection is not optional: HWI's `--device-type` connects to "the
first device of this type enumerated", so two devices of one vendor make which
one signs a question of enumeration order.

Both take a `network: str`, and both put it through
`network.validated_network_name`, which ignores the case and the ASCII
whitespace around the name, the tolerance btclib-org/btclib#216 decided to
keep: a name the rest of the library resolves is resolved here, and one no
network answers to is refused in the same words whichever of the two took it.

The subprocess is bounded twice. `timeout` is how long a command may run
-- a device waiting for a button press is the ordinary case, so the
default is generous and a caller signing unattended should lower it --
and `max_output` is how much of its answer is accepted: HWI answers with
one json object, and a backend that sends megabytes is one whose output
is not read to the end. It bounds stdout and stderr separately, and it
bounds what is written rather than what is parsed: both streams go to
temporary files whose size is watched while the child runs, so a backend
past the limit is killed where it stands rather than read to EOF into
memory and measured afterwards.

What a caller supplies reaches HWI's argparse as an argument, where one
starting with `-` would be read as an option: so the caller's text goes
after a `--`, which ends the options, and an option's value is joined to
its flag, `--registration=<value>`, which `--` does not reach.

The psbt grows with what it carries, a `non_witness_utxo` being a whole
previous transaction, and a command line is capped: one argument at
32 pages on Linux, 128 KiB where a page is 4 KiB, the whole of it at
32 767 characters on Windows and at `ARG_MAX` on macOS. So `sign_psbt`
passes `--stdin` and writes the psbt to HWI's standard input instead,
which no such limit caps.

That is not where everything goes. HWI splits each line it reads there
with `shlex.split` and parses the result with the same argparse, so a
value starting with `-` needs its `--` there too, and a value holding a
newline cannot be written at all -- which a message may hold, and a
base64 psbt never does. And `shlex.split` builds a token one character
at a time, copying it each time, so HWI's reading of a psbt grows with
the square of its length: `timeout` bounds it like any other wait.

Failures come back as `exceptions.SignerError`, carrying HWI's own error
code where there is one: -14 is the user pressing the button that says
no, -3 is a cable, -9 is a model that will never do it. The one failure
that is not about a device -- the executable is not installed -- is the
`SignerNotFoundError` subclass, so that a caller which also offers
signers of other kinds can tell "no hardware here" from "the hardware
could not be reached" without matching on the text of a message.
`is_available` is that one question asked *before* anything is run, which is
when a caller deciding what to offer at all has to have the answer: a
refusal is the right answer to a question that was asked, and the wrong
way to find out there was nothing to ask.

## Wallet policies

A Ledger will not display or sign a multisig it has not been shown
first. BIP388 wallet policies are how it is shown, and registration is a
one-time exchange ending in an HMAC the host keeps and replays on every
later call. `hwilib/_cli.py` exposes `registerdescriptor` for that
exchange, and `HwiSigner.register_descriptor` wraps it the way `getxpub`
and `signmessage` are wrapped: one request, one opaque answer, nothing
here to check it against.

No HWI release through 3.2.0 carries that subcommand -- it is on
`master` -- and `.github/workflows/integration-hwi.yml` installs the
release its `HWI_VERSION` names, one of those, so the weekly
`integration-hwi` job runs a command line `register_descriptor` cannot
reach. Raising that value to the first release whose `hwilib/_cli.py`
adds `registerdescriptor` is what ends the wait, and what makes this
paragraph removable.

`displayaddress`'s BIP388 policy mode -- `--registration`, `--index`,
`--multipath-index` -- is `HwiSigner.display_policy_address`, on the same
unreleased footing as `register_descriptor`: no release through 3.2.0
carries it either, so it runs against `master` and against the stand-in
`tests/hwi_test.py` writes, never against the pinned release.
`psbt_signer.WalletPolicyAddressDisplay`/`display_policy_address` are the
protocol and the check beside `AddressDisplay`/`display_address`:
`descriptors.wallet_policy_address` computes the address a policy
describes at an index and a multipath index, from the template and
key-information vector `descriptors.wallet_policy` writes when the
policy is built, and `display_policy_address` compares it with what the
device shows the way `display_address` compares a device's screen with a
plain `Descriptor` (issue btclib-org/btclib#1588).

Staying aligned with a project this does not import is two things, and
neither is a copy of it. `tests/hwi_test.py` writes out the surface used
-- the commands, the flags, the answer keys, the error codes -- and
`tests/_data/README.md` pins `hwilib/_cli.py` and `hwilib/errors.py` to
the revisions it was read from, so the weekly upstream re-check reports
a command line that moved. What that already caught: `signtx` answers
`signed` beside the psbt, which `sign_psbt` now holds the two strings to.

        runs itself before `combine`.

        What is checked here is the other thing, and only this layer can:
        `signtx` answers `signed` beside the psbt -- HWI computes it as
        "the base64 I return is not the base64 I was given" -- so the flag

        while handing back what it was sent, or denying it while handing
        back something else, has answered inconsistently, and the psbt is
        not the place that shows it: the comparison is over the very
        strings that crossed the boundary.

        A device that signed nothing is not an error and does not raise.
        One signer of an m-of-n answers for its own key and for no other,
        which is the same answer `psbt.sign` gives by adding nothing; what
        a caller compares is the psbt it gets back.

        A psbt paying a silent payment is asked BIP375's Signer rules
        before `hwi` runs, as `request_signatures` asks them: a device
        need not know BIP375, and this method is public, so a caller
        reaching it directly would otherwise send the device a psbt
        `psbt.sign` refuses.

        A psbt asking for a sig_hash type other than SIGHASH_ALL or
        SIGHASH_DEFAULT is sent only where allowed_sig_hash_types names it,
        the rule `psbt.sign` applies (issue #243). A device signs whatever
        type the psbt asks for, so the check is made here, before `hwi`
        runs. `request_signatures` does not pass its allow-list on, so a
        caller who accepts other types calls this method directly and holds
        the answer with `assert_signatures_only` before `combine`.

        SIGHASH_SINGLE with no output at the input's index is never sent,
        whatever is allowed, for any kind of input: the signature commits
        to no output.

        SIGHASH_DEFAULT on an input not known to be taproot is refused
