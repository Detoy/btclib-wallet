"""Tests for what the package exports.

Every module and package of btclib_wallet declares an `__all__`, at every
depth: a name is public here because a list says so, not because it
happens to lack a leading underscore. A list per module is a list per
module to keep true, and the policy tests below are what keeps it, rather
than a reviewer noticing.

`btclib_wallet.__all__` is the root of that tree, and one of those tests
walks it from the root, into every module-valued export, down to a node
that has none.

These tests are written against the names rather than the counts, so that a
deliberate addition is one line here and an accidental one is a failure.
