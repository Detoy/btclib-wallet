"""The gate for the bool contract, over what only a fixture can reach.

btclib's rule that every public function validates its inputs states
rules about a function that answers a `bool`, and btclib's own
`bool_contract_test.py` holds its verifications to them. A signature
verification takes a valid message, address and signature, which no
vocabulary of wrong values can build, so the calls here are
hand-written: "a hand-written table of name, and the shortest call that
reaches the validator", issue btclib-org/btclib#776's answer to what an
automatic walk cannot reach. Each case names a function, a call of it
that answers True, a wrong value for each position worth driving, and a
structurally invalid one for each position where the two diverge. Three
rules, asked one position at a time with the others left valid:

- a **wrong type** leaves as a `BTClibTypeError`. A bool is an answer
  about a value, so a type the signature does not declare is not
  something it answers about.
- a **wrong value** of a declared type is `False`. That is what the bool
  is for, and what a caller filtering signatures off the wire relies on.
- a value of a declared type whose size or encoding makes it
  **structurally invalid** -- one no valid input could ever carry, as
  opposed to one that is merely not authentic -- is a `BTClibValueError`.
  A verification is not the question that value answers, so it is
  refused rather than read as a forged signature.

A case marked `ecc=True` hands its arguments on to btclib_ecc, and the
first and the third rule then accept the classes of
`tests/exception_family_test.py`'s families (btclib-org/btclib#2282).

Issue btclib-org/btclib#814 settled the second rule, and issue
btclib-org/btclib#2181 carried the third into `bip322.verify`, where the
encoding stands in for the size.
