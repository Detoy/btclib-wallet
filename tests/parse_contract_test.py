"""Tests for the parse contract every `parse` in this package owes its caller.

btclib's contract, which `btclib.utils` states: a field is as long as its
encoding says, a complete octet string is one whole object, and a caller's
stream is the caller's. What the tests hold every parser to is that none
of the three depends on `check_validity`, which is an opinion about what
the bytes mean and not about where they end.

The inventory at the top is what those tests run over, and the last test
is what makes it a promise rather than a list: it walks the package for
every public class carrying a `parse` and fails unless each one is either
in the inventory or in a table of exclusions naming its reason. A parser
added here and forgotten in the inventory would otherwise be held to
nothing.
