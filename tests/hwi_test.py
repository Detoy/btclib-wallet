"""Tests for the `btclib_wallet.hwi` module, with no HWI installed.

The device is a stand-in: a Python script this module writes out, run as
`[sys.executable, script]`, which answers each command from a table the
test wrote into it. That is the whole point of a subprocess adapter being
testable -- HWI declares `hidapi`, `libusb1`, `cbor2`, `pyserial`,
`noiseprotocol`, `protobuf` and vendor libraries, and none of them has to
exist for these to run.

`[sys.executable, script]` rather than a shebang and a chmod: a shebang
is not how Windows runs anything, and the matrix has a Windows job.

What the stand-in answers is HWI's own shapes, read from its `_cli.py`
and `errors.py`: a list for `enumerate`, `{"xpub": …}`, `{"psbt": …,
"signed": …}`, `{"signature": …}`, `{"address": …}` for the rest, and
`{"error": …, "code": …}` for a failure. The signing answers are made by
`psbt_signer.SoftwareSigner`, so the psbt that comes back is one a real
device could have sent -- which is what lets the checks in `psbt_signer`
run over it here.

The tables below that transcription is written out in are the other half
of staying aligned with a project btclib does not import: they say what
btclib sends and reads, and `tests/_data/README.md` pins the two upstream
paths they were read from, so the weekly re-check reports a command line
that moved. The module cites, the README carries the revision -- the same
split every vendored vector here has.
