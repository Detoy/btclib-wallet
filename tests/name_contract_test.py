"""The gate for what a public function's name promises about its answer.

btclib's rule that every public function validates its inputs states the
vocabulary: `assert_*` refuses and returns None, `is_*` and `verify*`
answer a bool about a value of a declared type, and `check_*` answers a
bool *and* refuses what cannot be an answer -- the one prefix that warns
a caller it still needs an `except`. A prefix that says several things
says nothing, which is what issue btclib-org/btclib#814 found, and
btclib's own `name_contract_test.py` holds btclib to it.

The rule is read off the annotations rather than off a list of names
somebody keeps in step. What it cannot see is the *contract*: that a
predicate is total over its values is a promise in prose, and only the
return type is here.

`_OTHER_CONTRACT` is what the rule does not cover, one entry per reason.
`test_what_is_excepted_still_needs_to_be` fails on an entry that has come
into line, so a name cannot keep an exemption it has stopped needing.
