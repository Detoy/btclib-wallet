"""Two psbts that crashed rust-bitcoin's combiner are read here.

`psbt_fuzz1.hex` and `psbt_fuzz2.hex` are rust-bitcoin's regression
inputs for that crash; `tests/_data/README.md` pins and describes them.
Each is well-formed on its own: a psbt with no input and no output, and
one global xpub with an origin of one or two steps. Bitcoin Core 31.1.0
reads both, and prints the origin asserted below, with:

    bitcoin-cli decodepsbt "$(xxd -r -p tests/psbt/_data/psbt_fuzz1.hex |
        base64 | tr -d '[:space:]')"

and the same with `psbt_fuzz2.hex`, under `global_xpubs`. So `Psbt.parse`
is asked to read them, not to refuse them, and to write back the bytes it
was given.
