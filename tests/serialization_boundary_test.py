"""The gate for what `parse`, `serialize`, `to_dict` and `from_dict` take.

btclib's rule that every public function validates its inputs, at the
boundary where an object meets octets, text or json: a value of a type
the signature does not declare leaves as a `BTClibTypeError`, a value of
a declared type that no valid input carries as a `BTClibValueError`.
Issue btclib-org/btclib#867 is where the family was measured, and btclib's
own `serialization_boundary_test.py` holds its half of it.

**Not the contract `parse_contract_test.py` holds.** That file asks where
the bytes end -- a field is as long as its encoding says, a complete octet
string is one whole object, a caller's stream is the caller's -- and this
one asks what type the argument is. The two are different questions about
the same methods, which is why the walk that finds every one of them is
`tests/__init__.py`'s and neither file's.

**`from_dict` is where the hazard is sharpest**: it is the json boundary,
so its input is whatever a schema mistake produced. A mapping missing a
field must not leave as a `KeyError`, which is neither a
`BTClibException` nor a `ValueError`; `btclib.utils.fields_from_json_object`
is the one line that answers both, and `btclib.utils.list_from_json_array`
the arrays it walks: `Sequence[Any]` accepts a `str` and a `Mapping`, so
an input handed where the list of them was meant would be as many inputs
as it had characters.

**`to_dict`, `serialize` and `b64encode` mostly have nothing to drive**:
their input is the object, which `built_object_contract_test.py` owns.
The exceptions are the arguments `_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS` records, and the last
test is what keeps that record honest -- one more added to this family
fails here until it is driven.

**Parametric above the byte boundary, mono-format at it.** `ec` and `hf`
are nowhere in this family: an encoding does not name its curve or its
hash function, so `parse(data, ec=...)` would not be parsing -- it would
be decoding under instruction, accepting in silence a caller who names
the wrong one (issue btclib-org/btclib#1084).
`test_the_family_takes_no_ec_or_hf` is what turns that from an agreement
into a gate.

`check_validity` is not driven anywhere in this file: it is a flag that
decides whether a check runs rather than what is computed, so it is read
for its truth.
