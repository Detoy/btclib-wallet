"""Non-regression tests for btclib_wallet, and the vendored vectors they read.

The vector files are the BIPs', Bitcoin Core's and a few other projects'.
Read them here and hand them to `pytest.mark.parametrize`, so that a
vector is a test rather than one turn of a loop inside a single test
function: xdist can then spread them over the cores, a failure names the
vector instead of the loop that was running it, and the vectors after the
first failure still run.

Here rather than in a `tests/vectors.py`: every Python file under
`tests/` is a test file except `__init__.py` and `conftest.py`, so the
loaders live in the package `__init__`, and shared test code lives in the
package `__init__` at every level.

This package is imported by every test module, before that module's own
body runs, so whatever this file executes at import time executes inside
every module's own measured reach. A literal is safe to share here at
module scope. Anything that calls into btclib's own arithmetic, or imports
a module of it that a test may want to reach first, is shared as a
function instead, and imports what it needs when a caller invokes it.
