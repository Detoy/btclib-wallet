"""Bitcoin Core's fuzz corpora of psbts and descriptors, replayed here.

`bitcoin-core/qa-assets` holds, per Core fuzz target, the inputs that
target's fuzzers found interesting. Where the target reads a psbt or a
descriptor, the same input goes to this package's parser for it. A
parser may refuse it with an exception of the families
`tests/exception_family_test.py` holds; any other exception is a defect.
btclib replays the directories its own parsers read, in its own
`tests/integration/qa_assets_test.py`, and leaves these to this package.

Skipped unless `BTCLIB_QA_ASSETS` names a qa-assets checkout:

    BTCLIB_QA_ASSETS=/path/to/qa-assets uv run pytest \
        tests/integration/qa_assets_test.py -n 0

`qa-assets.yml` runs it weekly against qa-assets' default branch,
sparse-checking out the directories `TARGETS` names.

`TARGETS` is the table from a qa-assets directory to the parser that
reads it. `reading` says how Core's target, a file of `src/test/fuzz/`
in `bitcoin/bitcoin`, reads the input. A `_deserialize` target reads an
object off the front of the input and ignores what follows
(`SpanReader{buffer} >> obj`), while `parse` on bytes refuses trailing
bytes; so those rows hand `parse` a `BytesIO`, which it leaves where the
object ends. Each parser that takes `check_validity` is replayed with it
on and off.

The `psbt` row is replayed as Core's target draws it. That target does
not read its input as a psbt: `FuzzedDataProvider`'s
`ConsumeRandomLengthString` draws a string from it, two backslashes
standing for one and a backslash before any other octet ending the
string, and `DecodeRawPSBT` reads that string as the whole of a psbt. A
second draw, from what the first left, is the psbt the target merges
into it. `_draws` is that draw, and both strings go to `Psbt.parse`.

`descriptor_parse` hands `parse` the input as text, one character per
octet, as Core's `std::string` holds it. Core parses each input twice,
with a checksum required and without; `parse` verifies a checksum where
there is one and requires none, which is the second, the first adding
only the refusal of an input without one. Core's target skips what
`IsTooExpensive` names, to spend its fuzzing time elsewhere; this replay
reads every input, and `qa-assets.yml`'s `timeout-minutes` bounds it.
