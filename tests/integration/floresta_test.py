"""`ElectrumFetcher` against a live `florestad`, plain and over TLS.

The unit tests answer from recorded replies, and a recorded reply cannot
drift. The fetcher reaches Floresta only through a transport that adds
`"jsonrpc": "2.0"`, which Floresta requires and the Electrum spec does not
(`conftest.py`'s `JsonRpc2Transport`). Every question the fetcher asks is
asked here of Floresta's Electrum server on both of its ports, and
compared with what the node itself says. The merkle branch is checked
against the root in the block the node holds, the header chunk against
the single headers, and the two history methods against each other.

Skipped unless `BTCLIB_INTEGRATION=1` and `BTCLIB_FLORESTAD` and
`BTCLIB_UTREEXOD` name the binaries; `conftest.py` has why there is a
second program and no `PATH` fallback.
