"""What the fetchers answer after a reorg, against a live `electrs`.

`CachingFetcher` caches `get_block_header` for ever and says why that is
safe: a reorg can replace the block at a height, and the headers a caller
builds a chain of then fail the `previous_block_hash` link to the stale
one. Here the node mines a block holding a
payment, a longer branch replaces that block, and the payment is replaced
by a conflicting one in the new branch.

Skipped unless `BTCLIB_INTEGRATION=1` and `BTCLIB_ELECTRS` names the
server's binary.
