"""`CompactFilterFetcher` against a node serving BIP157 over p2p.

The unit tests answer the fetcher from a script; only a node can say that
the messages it sends are ones Bitcoin Core answers, that a filter Core
built hashes to the filter header Core serves, and that the headers Core
mines pass the retarget rules. The node is this module's own, started with
`-blockfilterindex -peerblockfilters` and listening on an ephemeral p2p
port, because the session's node of the conftest beside this does not
listen at all.

Skipped unless `BTCLIB_INTEGRATION=1` and a `bitcoind` is available.
