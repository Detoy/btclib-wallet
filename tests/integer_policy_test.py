"""Tests for the one policy on integer fields: a bool is not a number.

The policy is btclib's, and `btclib.utils.is_integer` states it; this file
holds the integer fields of this package to it, as btclib's own
`integer_policy_test.py` holds btclib's. What makes it worth a refusal is
the json boundary: `true` decodes to `True`, and a schema mistake would
become one index or one participant instead of failing beside the input
that caused it.
