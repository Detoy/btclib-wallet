"""An atheris harness fuzzing `btclib_wallet.psbt.psbt.Psbt`'s two decoders.

A psbt travels between wallets that do not trust each other -- that is
what it is for -- and every one of them parses what the last one wrote
before any signature in it has been looked at. Its own maps are
length-prefixed keys and values whose types decide how the value is read,
which is a deserializer taking a stranger's own numbers, and BIP174's
file form wraps the whole of it in base64 that anybody can paste.

`parse` is the octets and `b64decode` is the armor in front of them, so
this harness runs both against the same input: neither is reachable from
the other, `b64decode` refusing what is not canonical base64 before
`parse` ever sees it. `Psbt.parse` dispatches to `PsbtIn.parse`,
`PsbtOut.parse` and the map and Taproot-tree readers of
`psbt_utils.py` for every record a psbt carries, so a corpus of real
psbts drives those readers too; each also has its own direct entry point
in the Hypothesis property suite, `tests/fuzz_test.py`.

A crash here on hostile bytes is a defect in the parser, never in this
harness: `data` is unconstrained bytes handed straight to each entry
point, `b64decode` taking bytes as the ascii it decodes them from.
`BTClibException` and `BTClibEccException` are what both answer
malformed input with, so that family is caught below as the expected
outcome. An `IndexError`, a `RecursionError` or an uncaught assertion is
not, and propagates to atheris as the finding it is.

The seed corpus is one of the BIP174 vectors
`tests/psbt/_data/bip174_test_vectors.json` carries, in both forms: the
octets `serialize` writes, and the base64 the vector itself is published
as. It also holds the two psbts that crashed rust-bitcoin's combiner,
`tests/psbt/_data/psbt_fuzz1.hex` and `psbt_fuzz2.hex`, as octets.
